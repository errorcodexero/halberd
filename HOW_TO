												A How-To Guide for ALL your robot needs
	
Useful terminal commands:
	-"CTRL+C" ends the current running command.
	-"cd [insert_name_here]" an be used to enter the [insert_name_here] ("cd .." will go up one level).
	-"ls" will list the files within the current directory.
	-"CTRL+L" will clear the terminal.
	-The â†‘ (up arrow) Key will replace the current command line with previously used commands.

How to fine tune the heights for the can lifter:
	1. Open the terminal emulator by using the "CTRL+ALT+T" keyboard shotcut on one of the software computers in linux.
	2. Type "cd ~/fourteentwentyfive.sting/control" into the terminal and press enter. This will move you to the directory that contains the robot code.
	3. Type "gedit height.cpp" and press enter. This opens the cpp file that contains the code you want.
	4. Scroll down in the file to line 83 as shown by the numbers on the left of the page.
	5. These six lines end with something like "target+=". The number between the "=" and the ";" is the number that changes the target height.
	6. Edit the number for the level you want indicated by the number folloing the "==" in the "()" after the "if" or "else if". Be sure to leave a ";" at the end of the line
	7. Save the file with the keyboard shortcut "CTRL+S" and close the window.
	8. Follow the steps of how to deploy robot code to move it to the robot. If something breaks, contact someone on the software subteam.
	
	The lines you will be changing will look somewhat like this:
		if(bins==1) target+=2;
		else if(bins==2) target+=.5;
		else if(bins==3) target+=-1;
		else if(bins==4) target+=-2.75;
		else if(bins==5) target+=(-TOTE_HEIGHT)+3.5;
		else if(bins==6) target+=(-TOTE_HEIGHT)+-2.5;
		
		(ayy lmao)
		
How to deploy code to the robot:
	1. Open the terminal emulator by using the "CTRL+ALT+T" keyboard shotcut on one of the software computers in linux.
	2. Type "cd ~/fourteentwentyfive.sting" into the terminal and press enter. This will move you to the directory that contains the robot code.
	3. Type "./runall2 --build" and press enter. If it fails, consult someone of software.
	4. Make sure you are connected to the robot by clicking the network symbol in the top right of the screen.
	5. Type "./deploy" and press enter. Wait until it finished by returning you to the command line. Then it should be on the robot
	IMPORTANT: If step 5 does not finish, THE ROBOT WILL NOT WORK.
