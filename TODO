HIGH PRIORITY:
	-Bug fixes
	-Auto-Mode
	-Move-tune this
	-Encoder integration


NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
	-Autonomous
		-Movement
	-Drivebase wheel encoders
		-Get all A/B lines working (electrical)
		-Turn on counting mode & see if works
		-Determine directions & scales of counts
		-Drive distance routine
	-Lifter Code
		-UI
		-figure out the limits of when we throw totes (i.e. how fast we can turn before we throw them off)
		-code to diagnose motor/encoder problems
	-Write logging code
	-OI:
		-put in outputs
		-into framework

		
NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
-Clean-up stuff:
	-use enum class more places
	-use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
-Meta IO information
	-Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
	-Make a data type to talk about different inputs
-Improve testing, make sims meaningful
-Audit code to see what each part of the robot does when in disabled mode
-Improve testing for toplevel.cpp
-Laptop configuration
	-ssh config:
		-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
		-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot
