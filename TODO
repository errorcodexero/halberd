HIGH PRIORITY:
-Bug fixes
-Sensor and Auto-Alignment
-OI(See Lower)
-Auto-Mode
        -Move-tune this
        -Full Auto
        -Auto mode switcher integration
        -Sensor integration
-Drive-to-wall/Drive-to-tote


NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
-Autonomous
        -Movement
        -Selection Method
-Figure out chute_collect in panel2015
-Drivebase wheel encoders
        -Get all A/B lines working (electrical)
        -Turn on counting mode & see if works
        -Determine directions & scales of counts
        -Drive distance routine
-Lifter Code
        -UI
        -figure out the limits of when we throw totes (i.e. how fast we can turn before we throw them off)
        -code to diagnose motor/encoder problems
        -track whether been to one of the ends yet?
-Write logging code
-OI:
        -put in outputs
                -into framework
                -figure out if need to reprogram the TI launchpad
-Automatic Operations
        -auto-align
                -test with totes
                -consider disabling when would be looking at the grabber
        -lift


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
-Drive to Wall
-Clean-up stuff:
        -use enum class more places
        -use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
-Meta IO information
        -Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
        -Make a data type to talk about different inputs
-Improve testing, make sims meaningful
-Audit code to see what each part of the robot does when in disabled mode
-Improve testing for toplevel.cpp
-Laptop configuration
        -ssh config:
                -Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
                -add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot
