MUST HAVE BY WILSONVILLE:
-Firmware Updates
	-Mandatory update at: http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2015/5112/en/ Serial Number:M79X91968
	-See marchupdates in ../doc

HIGH PRIORITY:
-Autonomous
	-Movement
	-Grab can
		-Can grabber:
			-check that the IO number in code is correct
	-Selection Method
-Bug fixes
	
6-HOUR WINDOW:
-Test all functions, drive, lifters, kickers etc.
-Test encoders?
-

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
-Figure out chute_collect in panel2015
-Add a slow button for the lifters
-Drivebase wheel encoders
	-Get all A/B lines working (electrical)
	-Turn on counting mode & see if works
	-Determine directions & scales of counts
	-Drive distance routine
-Lifter Code
	-UI
	-figure out the limits of when we throw totes (i.e. how fast we can turn before we throw them off)
	-code to diagnose motor/encoder problems
	-track whether been to one of the ends yet?
-Write logging code
-OI:
	-put in outputs
		-into framework
		-figure out if need to reprogram the TI launchpad 
-Update Driver Station and look into other software updates in the manual (Mandatory update at: http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2015/5112/en/ Serial Number:M79X91968) -Jacob
-Automatic Operations
	-auto-align
		-test w/ totes
		-consider disabling when would be looking at the grabber
	-lift


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
-Drive to Wall
-Cleanup stuff:
	-use enum class more places
	-use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
-Meta IO information
	-Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
	-Make a datatype to talk about different inputs
-Improve testing, make sims meaningful
-Audit code to see what each part of the robot does when in disabled mode
-Improve testing for toplevel.cpp
-Laptop configuration
	-ssh config:
		-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
		-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot
